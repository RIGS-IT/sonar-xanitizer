A finding identified by the external 'OWASP Dependency Check' plugin:
axis-1.4.jar

=====================
---------------------
CVE-2012-5784
---------------------
CVSS V2 Score: 5.8
CVSS V3 Score: not available

National Vulnerability Database of NIST reports:
Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

The vulnerability in the library is assigned by the National Vulnerability Database of NIST to the CWE: CWE-20

The confidence level 'HIGH' based on the following CPE:
 cpe:2.3:a:apache:axis:* up to version 1.4
=====================


=====================
---------------------
CVE-2014-3596
---------------------
CVSS V2 Score: 5.8
CVSS V3 Score: not available

National Vulnerability Database of NIST reports:
The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784. <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html" target="_blank">CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch</a>

The vulnerability in the library is assigned by the National Vulnerability Database of NIST to the CWE: NVD-CWE-Other

The confidence level 'HIGH' based on the following CPE:
 cpe:2.3:a:apache:axis:* up to version 1.4
=====================


=====================
---------------------
CVE-2018-8032
---------------------
CVSS V2 Score: 4.3
CVSS V3 Score: 6.1
