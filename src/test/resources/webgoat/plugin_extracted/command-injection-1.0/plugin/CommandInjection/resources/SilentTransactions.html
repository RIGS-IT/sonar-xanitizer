<b>How the attacks works:</b>
</p>
Any system that silently processes transactions using a single submission is dangerous to the client. 
For example, if a normal web application allows a simple URL submission, a preset session attack will 
allow the attacker to complete a transaction without the user’s authorization. 
In Ajax, it gets worse: the transaction is silent; it happens with no user feedback on the page, 
so an injected attack script may be able to steal money from the client without authorization.<br>

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
* This is a sample internet banking application - money transfer page.<br>
* It shows below your balance, the account you are transferring to and amount you will transfer.<br>
* The application uses AJAX to submit the transaction after doing some basic client side validations.<br>
* Your goal is to try to bypass the user's authorization and silently execute the transaction.<br>
