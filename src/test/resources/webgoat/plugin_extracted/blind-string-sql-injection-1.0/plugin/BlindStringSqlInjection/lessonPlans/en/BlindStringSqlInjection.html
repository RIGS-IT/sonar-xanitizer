<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Blind String SQL Injection</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
    SQL injection attacks represent a serious threat to any database-driven site. The methods behind an attack are easy to learn and the damage caused can range from considerable to complete system compromise. Despite these risks, an incredible number of systems on the internet are susceptible to this form of attack.
    <br><br>
    Not only is it a threat easily instigated, it is also a threat that, with a little common-sense and forethought, can easily be prevented.<br>
    <br>
    It is always good practice to sanitize all input data, especially data that will used in OS command, scripts, and database queries, even if the threat of SQL injection has been prevented in some other manner.<br>

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
    The form below allows a user to enter an account number and determine if it is valid or not. Use this form to develop a true / false test check other entries in the database.<br/>

    The goal is to find the value of the field name in table pins for the row with the cc_number of 4321432143214321. The field is of type varchar, which is a string.<br/>

    Put the discovered name in the form to pass the lesson. Only the discovered name should be put into the form field, paying close attention to the spelling and capitalization.<br/>
