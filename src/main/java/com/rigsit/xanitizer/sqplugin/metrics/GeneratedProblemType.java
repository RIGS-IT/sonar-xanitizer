In that scenario request attributes can be directly accessed in\n			Freemarker templates, without involvement of application code. This makes the web application potentially vulnerable to XSS."),

Java code is not any more protected against buffer overflow vulnerabilities when invoking native code.\n			Exploitation of such vulnerabilities occurs in the same way - regardless if accessed directly in the foreign code or through JNI.\n			\n			Therefore it is important to understand what kind of native methods are invoked. \n			This problem type searches in all workspace methods belonging to the callgraph and finds all locations where JNI is potentially used. \n			There could be false positives if an invocation occurs via super/interface class \n			and there are several sub classes of which just a subset has a native method."),
